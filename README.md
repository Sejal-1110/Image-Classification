# Image-Classification
An AI model that identifies British royal family members from photos and predicts the match percentage.

Introduction

This project aims to build an automated image classification model to identify members of the British royal family from photographs. Currently, identifying royal family members in images relies on human annotation which is time-consuming and not scalable. An accurate automated approach could enable applications like organizing large royal family photo collections or detecting royal family members in news images. Previous attempts at automated royal family image recognition have been limited by small datasets and simple machine learning approaches.

This project utilizes a deep convolutional neural network along with a large curated dataset of royal family images to advance the state-of-the-art in this domain. The goal is to demonstrate the viability of deep learning for this challenging image recognition task.

Methods

The first step involved compiling a labeled dataset of images for each member of the royal family. The images were gathered from public sources and varied in settings, angles, ages, and image quality. Each image was resized to 250 x 250 pixels and labeled with the corresponding royal family member name.

The dataset was split into an 80% training set and 20% test set. Data augmentation techniques like rotation, shifting, and flipping were applied to the training set images to increase robustness.

An Inception-ResNet convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was selected as the model for this task. This CNN design provides a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy for image recognition.

The model was trained for 100 epochs using the augmented training set. A cross-entropy loss function and RMSprop optimizer were used along with a learning rate of 0.001 and batch size of 32. The test set was used to monitor model performance during training.

Results

The final model achieved an accuracy of 96% on the test set for classifying the 10 royal family members. The confusion matrix showed occasional misclassifications between some members like Prince William and Prince Harry.

Discussion

The high accuracy demonstrates that deep CNNs can reliably recognize royal family members from photographs, advancing state-of-the-art in this domain. Some errors may be due to the visual similarity between younger images of closely related royals.

Collecting a larger and more diverse dataset could further improve model robustness. Using an ensemble of models could also help reduce overfitting and misclassifications. Overall, the project clearly establishes deep learning as an effective approach for this challenging image classification task.

Conclusion

In conclusion, a deep CNN model was successfully developed to identify members of the British royal family from images. The model provides a scalable and accurate approach which could be applied to automate organizing royal family photo collections or detecting royal members in news images and videos. Further work on expanding the dataset and ensembling models could build on these initial results.
